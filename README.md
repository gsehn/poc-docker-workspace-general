# poc-docker-workspace-general

Attempt to create an environment for general software development (terraform, aws, docker, git, node, js/ts).
I've done it in the past and integrated with another IDE, so I am just trying to do it again and making sure I store it properly. :)

## Requirements

- Yarn Cache - make sure your user is the owner of your local Yarn cache folder (run `yarn cache dir`)

## History

- 2020-01-26 - Added a bunch of stuff, like Node, Python, AWS CLI, Terraform, and a few ubuntu configurations to make it more enjoyable, like .bashrc, aliases, etc
